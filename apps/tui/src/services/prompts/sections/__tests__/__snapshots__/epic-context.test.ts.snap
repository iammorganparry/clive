WORKTREE CONTEXT:
This build session may be running in a git worktree. Check for worktree state:

If the file ".claude/.worktree-branch" exists in the current directory, you are in a worktree.
- Read it to confirm you are on the expected branch
- All work MUST stay within this worktree directory
- Do NOT modify files in the main repository
- The main repo path is in ".claude/.worktree-origin" if you need to reference it

Verify workspace before starting:
  if [ -f ".claude/.worktree-branch" ]; then
      EXPECTED_BRANCH=$(cat .claude/.worktree-branch)
      CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
      if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "$EXPECTED_BRANCH" ]; then
          echo "WARNING: Expected branch $EXPECTED_BRANCH but on $CURRENT_BRANCH"
          git checkout "$EXPECTED_BRANCH"
      fi
      echo "Working in worktree: $(pwd) (branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH)"
  else
      echo "Working in main repo: $(pwd) (branch: $(git branch --show-current))"
  fi

EPIC CONTEXT:
The TUI has an active epic selected. The following environment variable is available in your bash environment:
  CLIVE_PARENT_ID="abc-123-def-456"
  CLIVE_EPIC_IDENTIFIER="CLIVE-42"

WORKTREE SETUP (MANDATORY when CLIVE_PARENT_ID is set):
You MUST create a git worktree for isolated work on this epic. Follow these steps:

1. Derive paths:
   BRANCH="clive/CLIVE-42"
   REPO_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
   WORKTREE_DIR="../\${REPO_NAME}-worktrees/CLIVE-42"

2. Create worktree (skip if already exists):
   if [ -d "$WORKTREE_DIR" ]; then
     echo "Worktree already exists at $WORKTREE_DIR"
   elif git rev-parse --verify "$BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     git worktree add "$WORKTREE_DIR" "$BRANCH"
   else
     git worktree add -b "$BRANCH" "$WORKTREE_DIR" origin/main
   fi

3. Write metadata to MAIN repo (so TUI can find the worktree):
   mkdir -p ".claude/epics/$CLIVE_PARENT_ID"
   cat > ".claude/epics/$CLIVE_PARENT_ID/worktree.json" << EOF
   {
     "worktreePath": "$(cd "$WORKTREE_DIR" && pwd)",
     "branchName": "$BRANCH",
     "epicId": "$CLIVE_PARENT_ID",
     "epicIdentifier": "$CLIVE_EPIC_IDENTIFIER",
     "createdAt": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
   }
   EOF

4. Write state files INSIDE the worktree (so build agent can verify):
   mkdir -p "$WORKTREE_DIR/.claude"
   echo "$BRANCH" > "$WORKTREE_DIR/.claude/.worktree-branch"
   echo "$(cd "$WORKTREE_DIR" && pwd)" > "$WORKTREE_DIR/.claude/.worktree-path"
   echo "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" > "$WORKTREE_DIR/.claude/.worktree-origin"

5. Install dependencies in worktree:
   cd "$WORKTREE_DIR" && yarn install --frozen-lockfile

After worktree creation, continue planning from the MAIN repo (do NOT cd into the worktree).
The TUI will automatically route build sessions to the worktree directory.
