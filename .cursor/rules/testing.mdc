# Testing Rules

## Never Run Tests Automatically

**CRITICAL**: Never run tests automatically using terminal commands. Always ask the user to run tests and relay the results.

## Rules

- **Never execute test commands** - Do not run `npm test`, `npm run test:unit`, `vitest`, or any test-related commands
- **Ask user to run tests** - When tests need to be verified, ask the user to run them
- **Wait for results** - After asking, wait for the user to provide test results before proceeding
- **Fix based on results** - Use the test results provided by the user to fix any failures

## Examples

### ✅ Good - Ask user to run tests

```typescript
// After creating or modifying tests, say:
"I've created the test file. Please run `npm run test:unit` and share the results."
```

### ❌ Bad - Running tests automatically

```bash
# Don't do this
npm run test:unit
```

## When to Ask for Tests

Ask the user to run tests when:
- Creating new test files
- Modifying existing tests
- After fixing test failures
- When verifying test coverage
- Before marking tasks as complete

## Test Commands

Common test commands in this project:
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests with Vitest
- `npm run test:unit:watch` - Run unit tests in watch mode
- `npm test` - Run VS Code extension tests

## Workflow

1. Create or modify test files
2. Ask user: "Please run `npm run test:unit` and share the results"
3. Wait for user to provide test output
4. Fix any failures based on the results
5. Repeat until all tests pass
